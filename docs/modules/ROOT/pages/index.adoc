= keycloak: A Commodore component to manage Keycloak

This component provides a set of tuned defaults and a simplified interface to
deploy the https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codecentric/keycloak/9.9.1[Keycloak helm
chart] on a Syn-enabled cluster.

The component defaults to provisioning a Bitnami Postgres database via the
Keycloak helm chart, but this behavior can be overridden using the
`keycloak.postgres` parameters exposed by the component.

[NOTE]
====
This component doesn't support Kubernetes versions older than 1.14 anymore.
This is because it generates `Ingress` resources with `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1`.
