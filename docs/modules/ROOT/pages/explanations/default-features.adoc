= Default features

Many Helm Charts in the Kubernetes community have advanced features disabled by default in order to ease installations without configuring much.
This is also the case with the Keycloak Helm chart this component depends upon.
However, this component aims to provision Keycloak secure by default, so a lot of defaults have activated advanced features.
This page gives an overview over the defaults.
