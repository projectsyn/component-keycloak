== OpenID Connect Discovery

Because of this change the well known openid configuration still shows the old path.

```
Original path: https://x.x.x.x/auth/realms/my_realm/.well-known/openid-configuration
Ajusted path: https://x.x.x.x/realms/my_realm/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

The verification check does detect the different paths fail and prevent the login.

```
ERROR: Failed to initialise OAuth2 Proxy: error intiailising provider: could not create provider data: error building OIDC ProviderVerifier: could not get verifier builder: error while discovery OIDC configuration: oidc: issuer did not match the issuer returned by provider,
```

As a example for oauth2-proxy: To prevent the OIDC client does reject itself you can add the https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/docs/configuration/overview/#command-line-options[parameter] to ignore the different paths:

```
--insecure-oidc-skip-issuer-verification
```
