= Upgrade from v5 to v6

This guide describes the steps to perform an upgrade of the component from version v5 to v6.

== Changes

Configuration of TLS aspect has been overhauled:
* Separation of internal (ingress to Keycloak) and external (client to ingress) TLS configuration
* Removal of "passthrough" TLS termination mode. "reencrypt" is used instead.


== Step-by-step guide

When upgrading the component, the following changes to the inventory are required:

. Remove `tls.termination`. It's not supported anymore.
. When using cert-manager for the ingress certificate, move `tls.certmanager.issuer.name` to `ingress.tls.certmanager.issuerName`
. Copy `tls.provider` to `ingress.tls.provider` if not using default values
